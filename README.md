# Overview

This project is a console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++. It allows users to add new tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display all current tasks in an organized list.  
The goal of building this software was to strengthen my understanding of C++ syntax, object-oriented programming, and use of the Standard Template Library (STL) for data management.  

By developing this project, I gained experience working with classes, vectors, functions, and input validation while building a small, but practical application that can be used as a productivity tool.

# Future Work
 
- Implement task categories or priorities to organize items better.  
- Add due dates and a way to sort tasks by date or priority.  
- Improve the user interface with color-coded output or a simple GUI framework like Qt.  
- Expand error handling to better manage invalid user input.
